flume (0.9.3b-sg58) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ dsmith ]
  * Added JMX beans for all reportable objects. Conflicts:
    src/java/com/cloudera/flume/reporter/MasterReportPusher.java
  * Specify a JMX port. Conflicts:  bin/flume
  * Added a new command called "status" that will load up information
    from all logical nodes on the current host using JMX.
  * Make sure to include the binary
  * Pull out the JMX_OPTIONS into their own local variable so we don't
    end up using them twice in a single command (e.g. watchdog and node)
    Conflicts:  bin/flume
  * Removed the try/catch statement
  * Added a source file

  [ Jonathan Hsieh ]
  * FLUME-516: bin/flume script does not properly load pre-existing
    hadoop jars

  [ gnoremac ]
  * FLUME-515: Modified FlumeMaster to register custom OutputFormats
    during startup
  * FLUME-509:Modified flume-daemon.sh to source flume-env.sh

  [ Jonathan Hsieh ]
  * Update CHANGELOG for rc2
